# RA Ross Author Site

# building the site
* have two terminals open. one open in the top dir and the other in `themes/daisy`
* run `hugo server` in the top dir and whenver a change is made to CSS, run `npm run build-tw` in the theme dir if the change doesn't show up

will need to figure out how to automate this soon, but it's working for now.
